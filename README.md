# AddToDesktopShell
Google removed the handy "Add to desktop" feature from Chrome. The feature installed any
web page in your OS to look like an app. You can fake Chrome out to installing a web
page like an app if you create a manifest and service worker.
Basically we are creating the minimum to lead Chrome to believe this is a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).
This repository is an example of that.

These are the minimum shell files for an app to mimic the remove "Add to Desktop" Chrome feature.
