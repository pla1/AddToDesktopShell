# AddToDesktopShell
Google removed the handy "Add to desktop" feature from Chrome. This feature installed any
web page in your OS to look like an app. You can fake Chrome out to install a web
page like an app if you create a manifest and service worker. This repository is an
example of that. Basically we are doing to minimum to lead Chrome to believe this is a PWA (progressive web app).

These are the minimum shell files for an app mimic the remove "Add to Desktop" Chrome feature.
